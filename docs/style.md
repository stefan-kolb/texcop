Focused on American English.
Often inspired by the Chicago Manual of Style.

## DoubleQuotationMarks

Use double quotation marks instead of single.
For nonspecialist texts, Chicago recommends double quotation marks for everything except quotations within quotations.

Example:

```text
"Let's get this thesis done!," he said.
The term "PaaS" is known to developers.
```
